    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        Color and typography choices influence much more than merely just colors on the screen. The colors that I choose reflect myself through the colors I like, the fonts I think are easy to read, or what I feel looks cool through my western-website trained eye. I chose the 5 colors from coolor because I feel like they provide a nice range for an “artistic” presentation of a website. It feels vibrant, and “bubblegum”-y in a way that I wanted to try something with colors I had never thought I would use before. Sticking with these colors, I wanted to come up with a font that captured the same kind of energy. Lighthearted and handwritten were the things I wanted to capture the most. Accessibility requirements didn’t really influence my design much, as coolor told me what font color to use right in the hex-codes. I had lots of difficulty getting webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker to work with my site. I learned that creating an all-encompassing design system is much more complicated than I originally thought. I did not know that you would have to manually create the hovers, the link-travels, nor the form attributes. I would like to apply this in a more simplistic way on my main portfolio site, something with less flashy colors to bring more attention to my projects. I would like to learn as many attributes as possible so that I can customize everything as much as possible in an external CSS file. Most things feel clunky, I would like to make buttons and forms actually submit to something, rather than being clicked and submitted into the void. For example, my buttons let you click, but nothing happens. I would like to attach a link each of the buttons so that you can navigate a bit easier than clicking on blue and purple hyperlinks.
