  <h2>Reflection</h2>

      This small expandable card component allows the user to pick and choose how much information they want to see. The flexbox allows the site to be seen on any screen size, of any device. It could constrain the view of the button, so accessibility may be difficult for some users. Users having the option to click to see more information puts the user in control of their experience on the site, which could be nice if a user is in a hurry to find more specific information, but could also be more difficult for users with screen readers due to the program reading each section individually and not as a whole.

      I like to think that the dynamic of digital power, user versus designer, reflects a desire to create a more interactive experience for the user. To allow them to choose what information they get to see. The assumption is that the user can choose what they view, but with all of the dropdown menus and expandable sections, it can create an environment where the user is not expected to read anything specific or in a specific order. On this project, I think that information that is necessary to know, is time and place and possibly location. The details of the event are not quite as important, because most users are only going to want to learn more if they know that they are available to attend.
